# Install required packages
# These are cached in the build-base image. Don't run `apt-get update` or
# you may get other package versions and the build won't be reproducible.

# Make sure that these stay the same, e.g., don't use "latest", but fixed versions.

# Avoid installing packages via apt here. This may change the version of already
# installed dependencies and may influence the final binary. If not using apt isn't
# feasible, consider building a Docker image that gathers all required apt packages
# and serves as a stable base.
