In the original SGX programming model, the application code is partitioned into trusted and untrusted code. The untrusted code runs in a conventional process. Within this process, one or more enclaves are created that execute the trusted code. The enclave is entered with an ECALL. The enclave can transfer execution to untrusted code by performing an OCALL.","sidebar":"docs"},"knowledge/storage":{"id":"knowledge/storage","title":"Secure storage","description":"EGo provides several ways to store data securely, which are described in the following sections.","sidebar":"docs"},"knowledge/tls":{"id":"knowledge/tls","title":"TLS inside the enclave","description":"Accepting or establishing TLS connections inside the enclave has peculiarities you should be aware of.","sidebar":"docs"},"reference/attest":{"id":"reference/attest","title":"Remote attestation","description":"Use remote attestation to verify that an EGo app is indeed running inside an enclave and to identify it by its hash.","sidebar":"docs"},"reference/cli":{"id":"reference/cli","title":"CLI reference","description":"After you\'ve compiled your app with ego-go, use the ego tool to sign, run, and examine your enclave app.","sidebar":"docs"},"reference/config":{"id":"reference/config","title":"Configuration file","description":"Your enclave\'s configuration is defined in JSON and applied when signing an executable via ego sign.","sidebar":"docs"},"workflows/build":{"id":"workflows/build","title":"Build your app with EGo","description":"ego-go replaces go","sidebar":"docs"},"workflows/debug":{"id":"workflows/debug","title":"Debug your app","description":"EGo executables can be debugged inside as well as outside of enclaves.
